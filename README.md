# Thermoporometry

Thermoporometry is a method for measuring porosity. This technique uses differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) to detect the phase changes. In this work, thermoporometry probes complementary dimensions of water interaction with cellulose.

Macro_Thermoporometry is an open-source data analysis. The calculations run by the macro are detail in Driemeire et al, 2012 (Paper: Artigo_Cellulose2012.pdf).

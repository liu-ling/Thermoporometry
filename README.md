#  Calorimetric thermoporometry

The shared files are employed in the determination of biomass nanoscale porosity in aqueous environment, following the analytical developments presented in the published article (see reference). The following files are included:

 - CNPEM Technical Memorandum that describes in detail the laboratory and data analysis procedures.
 - A text file that exemplifies instrument output data.
 - Microsoft Excel macro that analyzes the instrument output data to construct thermoporometry profiles (FBW × pore diameter).
